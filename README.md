# PMCXMLConverters

PMC XML Converters

These XSL files convert PMC Style-compliant JATS XML:
* __pmc2crossref.xsl__ - For article submission to [CrossRef](http://www.crossref.org/). CrossRef also has their own [NLM/JATS to CrossRef converter](http://support.crossref.org/entries/22577813-niso-jats-nlm-dtd-to-crossref-schema-conversion-xslt).
* __pmc2pubmed.xsl__ - For article submission to [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed).

Both PubMed and CrossRef accept submissions of sets of multiple articles. These converters currently work with a single article at a time, but can be edited to convert and wrap multiple articles into a set.

### See also

[CrossRef](http://crossref.org) has also prepared a (preliminary) [XSLT converter](http://help.crossref.org/#nlm-to-crossref-conversion) for doing this same task.  You might want to check their version to see if it better meets your needs.
